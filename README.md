# Arduino+Android Projects For Evil Genius
The book contains detailed instructions for constructing various projects that use Arduino and
Android devices. Some of the projects, such as the Geiger Counter and the Ultrasonic Distance Meter, are
essentially electronic accessories for your Android phone.
Other projects in the book work toward a home automation system, complete with electric door lock
and a remote control for power and heating, making even home automation accessible from the Internet
and your Android device.
